CS-300 Portfolio Reflection
Overview

In this course, I focused on data structures and algorithms to solve real-world software problems. My projects centered around building a program for ABC University that could store, manage, and sort course information for the Computer Science department. Through these projects, I learned how to analyze efficiency, apply different data structures, and design programs that are both reliable and adaptable.

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The main goal was to design and implement a system that could efficiently store course data and allow advisors to search for, display, and sort courses by their identifiers. This required evaluating multiple data structures—such as vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees—to determine which provided the best balance of speed and memory efficiency for different operations like inserting, searching, and sorting.

How did you approach the problem?

I approached the problem by first understanding the requirements of each data structure and their expected performance. I implemented and analyzed them to see how each handled the course data set. By comparing their run-time complexities, I was able to determine which structure was most efficient for different tasks. Understanding how data structures manage memory and access patterns was key to writing optimized code.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

One of the main challenges was debugging logic errors that caused incorrect data sorting or incomplete file parsing. I overcame this by using step-by-step tracing and output testing to confirm that each part of the program was behaving as expected. Another difficulty was managing file input and ensuring that improperly formatted lines didn’t break the program. Careful error checking and validation helped make the system more robust.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project helped me think more critically about the structure of data and the efficiency of algorithms. Rather than focusing only on getting a program to “work,” I learned to think about scalability and performance. I now consider how each design choice—such as which data structure to use—affects both runtime and memory usage as the data set grows.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Working through these projects reinforced the importance of writing clean, modular, and well-commented code. I began organizing my functions around specific responsibilities and avoided hard-coding values so that the program could be easily updated in the future. I also made sure that my variable names and structure definitions were clear and self-explanatory, making the code easier for others (and myself) to understand later.
